Chong's Siomai Rice: Website Rehaul and Digital Proposal

I. Project Overview: The Digital Spark

This project serves as a professional proposal for a complete digital overhaul for Chong's Siomai Rice, a beloved local food vendor.

While their culinary quality is undeniably strong, they currently operate primarily through physical stalls and localized social media, lacking a centralized, professional web presence.

The core objective is to launch a modern, Single Page Application (SPA) built with the latest version of React. This will simplify information access, capture the mobile market, and provide a professional digital storefront that is fully mobile-responsive.

II. The Client: Chong's Siomai Rice

A. Background

Chong's Siomai Rice is a popular, small-scale food vendor known for offering affordable, high-quality, and satisfying meals, particularly their namesake siomai and rice combinations. They are deeply rooted in the local community and rely heavily on word-of-mouth.

B. Current Digital State

Since Chong's Siomai Rice is a small, local entity, they do not possess a formal corporate website. Their primary digital presence is limited to social media.

Reference Point: The base for this rehaul proposal is their official Facebook page:

C. Need for Improvement (The Proposal Pitch)

Issue

Solution Provided by the SPA

Lack of Centralization

A dedicated site consolidates the menu, locations, and pricing, eliminating customer confusion and friction.

Limited Brand Credibility

A formal, custom website immediately elevates the brand's perceived value and trustworthiness, signaling readiness for scaling.

Poor User Experience

The SPA provides immediate, structured access to information, replacing the frustrating necessity of scrolling through endless social media feeds.

III. Technical Implementation Details

A. Core Technology

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using React 19 and styled with Tailwind CSS (as demonstrated in the code) or React Bootstrap. All content is dynamically rendered using self-generated dummy data that adheres to proper JavaScript naming conventions.

B. Component Reusability

Demonstrating component reusability is key for a clean codebase and efficient development. Key standardized components include:

NavBar: Used across all routes for primary navigation and branding consistency.

Footer: Displays contact and copyright information consistently at the bottom of every page.

MenuItemCard: A reusable template designed to display individual menu items (image, name, description, price) by mapping over the menuItems dummy data.

TeamMemberCard: Used on the About page to present team members' details in a standardized layout.

IV. Getting Started (Setup & Scripts)
