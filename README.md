Chong's Siomai Rice Website Rehaul and Digital Proposal
Project Overview: The Digital Spark
This project is a professional proposal for a complete digital overhaul for Chong's Siomai Rice, a beloved local food business specializing in various siomai (Filipino steamed dumplings) and rice meals. While their culinary game is undeniably strong, they currently operate primarily through physical stalls and social media, lacking a centralized, professional web presence.

The goal of this rehaul is to launch a modern, Single Page Application (SPA) built with the latest version of React to capture their market, simplify information access, and provide a professional digital storefront. This solution will be mobile-responsive, ensuring a smooth experience for customers ordering on the go.

The Client: Chong's Siomai Rice
Background: Chong's Siomai Rice is a popular, small-scale food vendor known for offering affordable, high-quality, and satisfying meals, particularly their namesake siomai and rice combinations. They are deeply rooted in the local community and rely heavily on word-of-mouth and localized social media activity.

Current State (Reference): Since Chong's Siomai Rice is a small, local entity, they do not possess a formal corporate website. Their primary digital presence is limited to social media.

Reference Point: Their current digital footprint, which serves as the base for our rehaul proposal, is their official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Chongs.Siomai/.

Need for Improvement (The Proposal Pitch):

Lack of Centralization: Information about their menu, locations, and pricing is scattered across various social media posts or must be actively requested, leading to customer confusion and friction. A dedicated site consolidates all these details.

Limited Brand Credibility: A formal, custom website immediately elevates the brand's perceived value and trustworthiness compared to relying solely on third-party platforms. It signals readiness for scaling operations.

Poor User Experience: Scrolling through endless social media feeds is a poor substitute for a dedicated, easy-to-navigate menu and about page. This SPA solves that problem by offering immediate, consolidated, and structured access to information.

Technical Implementation Details
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using React 19 and styled with React Bootstrap (or Tailwind CSS, as an acceptable alternative styling choice). All content is dynamically rendered using self-generated dummy data that adheres to proper JavaScript naming conventions.

Component Reusability
A core requirement of this project is demonstrating component reusability, essential for maintaining a clean codebase and efficient development cycle. Key standardized components include:

NavBar: Used across all routes for primary navigation and branding consistency.

Footer: Displays contact and copyright information consistently at the bottom of every page.

MenuItemCard: A template component designed to display individual menu items (image, name, description, price) efficiently. This component is mapped over the menuItems dummy data.

TeamMemberCard: Used on the About page to present team members' details in a standardized, professional layout.

Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
